# Another text editor

Why another text editor? Isn't sublime text is enough?

This text editor is created purely for one selfish reason: I need something that tailor to *my* workflow.

I create a lot of text file during my day of work. Most of the content are not worth saving. However, some are
valuable.

I want the text editor to save them all, with snapshots. So I can go back anytime to find any text that I store in the
past.

Storage is cheap. Why choose a frugal life?

You can edit code with it. However, it isn't created to be a code editor.

Don't use it like one.

You are free to fork to create the ones that suit your need.

PR/MR are welcome.
